<p>
  I developed an X-Twitter-Clone using React features and firebase database. You can open a new account. You can log in to your account via email or Google. Can tweet messages or pictures. You can update your tweets. can delete your tweets. You can send likes to your tweets. You can log out of your account securely. A pop-up will appear for every change you make. I used tailwind features for the page design.</p>
